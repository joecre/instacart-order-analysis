# Instacart Customer Order Analysis

## Overview

This project analyzes customer behavior on the Instacart grocery platform using publicly available data. The goal was to identify meaningful patterns in how and when customers place orders, which products they reorder most often, and what items they tend to add to their carts first.

## Key Insights

- Most orders are placed between 9 AM and 5 PM, with Sundays being the busiest day.
- Customers frequently reorder the same group of top products.
- A small number of users are responsible for the majority of repeat purchases.
- The products added first to shopping carts reveal strong preferences that could inform targeted marketing.

## Tools and Technologies

- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook
